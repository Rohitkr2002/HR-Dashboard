# HR Dashboard Using Power BI
 ## Project Overview

The HR Dashboard Using Power BI is a comprehensive business intelligence solution created to analyze and visualize Human Resource data in a clear, interactive, and actionable format.

Modern organizations generate large amounts of employee data ‚Äî from demographics and salaries to attrition and performance trends. However, raw data often lacks structure and visibility. This project solves that problem by converting static HR data into a dynamic, easy-to-understand dashboard that provides key insights into the workforce.

Through the integration of Power BI, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and Power Query, this dashboard helps HR professionals and management teams:
Monitor critical employee metrics such as headcount, attrition rate, average age, and average salary.
Identify trends and patterns related to employee turnover and retention.
Understand department-level insights, such as which departments have higher attrition or salary variation.
Explore demographic diversity through visual filters like gender, education, and job roles.
Make strategic HR decisions backed by data ‚Äî improving retention, employee satisfaction, and workforce planning.
